<h2>Sisters에 대해</h2>
<p>용어</p>
The term sister comes from Old Norse systir which itself derives from Proto-Germanic *swestēr, both of whom have the same meaning, i.e. sister. Some studies have found that sisters display more traits indicating jealousy around their siblings than their male counterparts, brothers.[2] In some cultures, sisters are afforded a role of being under the protection by male siblings, especially older brothers from issues ranging from bullies or sexual advances by womanizers.[3] In some quarters the term sister has gradually broadened its colloquial meaning to include individuals stipulating kinship.[4] In response, in order to avoid equivocation, some publishers prefer the usage of female sibling over sister.[5] Males with a twin sister, sometimes view her as their female alter ego, or what they would have been like, if they had two X chromosomes.

Various studies have shown that an older sister is likely to give a varied gender role to their younger siblings as well as being more likely to develop a close bond with their younger siblings.[7] Older sisters are more likely to play with their younger siblings.[8] Younger siblings display a more needy behavior when in close proximity to their older sister[9] and are more likely to be tolerant of an older sister's bad behavior.[10] Boys with only an older sister are more likely to display stereotypically male behavior, and such masculine boys increased their masculine behavior with the more sisters they have.[11] The reverse is true for young boys with several sisters, as they tend to be feminine, however, they outgrow this by the time they approach pubescence.[12] Boys with older sisters were less likely to be delinquent or have emotional and behavioral disorders.[13] A younger sister is less likely to be scolded by older siblings than a younger brother.[14] The most common recreational activity between older brother/younger sister pairs is art drawing.[7] Some studies also found a correlation between having an older sister and constructive discussions about safe sexual practices.[15] Some studies have shown that men without sisters are more likely to be ineffectual at courtship and romantic relationships
